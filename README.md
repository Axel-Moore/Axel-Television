# Axel-Television
Univeral CRT Shader for all games/emulators/apps based in D3D, OpenGL or Vulkan.

I were working in the idea of create a CRT Shader for all type of content, this shader looks good in all games.


¦¦¦ Welcome to Axel TV CRT Shader ¦¦¦

How to install:

1- First you need to install ReShade from https://reshade.me/

   Execute it, select you game path .exe, select your api (d3d, ogl or vulkan), and dont install any shader.

   Just skip and exit.

2- Extract the content from Axel-TV.zip to your game directory.

3- Execute the game and press HOME to enable or disable the shader.

█ Thank you to all Reshade / Retroarch guys from discord.

Special thanks to Mattsilagi for help me porting some shaders.
