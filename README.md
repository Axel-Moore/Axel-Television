# Axel-Television
Univeral CRT Shader for all games/emulators/apps based in D3D, OpenGL or Vulkan.

I were working in the idea of create a CRT Shader for all type of content, this shader looks good in all games.

¦¦¦ Welcome to Axel TV CRT Shader ¦¦¦

V 0.2 Changes
------------------------------------

- Most important change: we are not going to use crt-royale to reduce cpu/gpu load. We will use another shader for diffusion effect.

How to install:

1- First you need to install ReShade from https://reshade.me/  The shader requires version 4.9.1

   Execute it, select you game path .exe, select your api (d3d, ogl or vulkan), and dont install any shader.

   Just skip and exit.

2- Extract the content from Axel-TV.zip to your game directory.

3- Execute the game and press HOME to enable or disable the shader.


''' The profile is optimized for 1080p but runs in most resolutions.

█ Thank you to all Reshade / Retroarch guys from discord.

Special thanks to Mattsilagi for help me porting some shaders.
